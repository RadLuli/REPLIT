## Flowchart Development Guide

When developing the system flowchart, consider these critical paths:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User login request → Google OAuth redirect → Auth callback → Profile verification → Session creation
   - Session validation → Profile access → Profile update → Session refresh
   - Session termination → Cleanup → Login page return

2. **Image Analysis Flow**
   - Image upload → Format validation → Preprocessing → Feature extraction
   - Technical analysis → Rating generation → Feedback creation → Translation
   - Results presentation → Database storage → User history update

3. **Enhancement Flow**
   - Image selection → Enhancement options display → Parameter selection
   - Enhancement application → Preview generation → Adjustment iteration
   - Final processing → Result storage → Download options

4. **Future RAG Integration Flow**
   - Document upload → Processing → Content extraction → Storage
